To complicate matters, in witchcraft circles there are other classifications beyond “good” and “bad.” Some speak of “white witches,” or witches who pledge to do no harm, and “black witches,” or those who will resort to hexes—though this language is quickly falling out of favor due to its racist undertones. Some speak of “left-handed” versus “right-handed” magic, signifying whether or not one is focused mainly on individual self-development as opposed to being beholden to a group or universal deity.

In Ronald Hutton’s book The Witch: A History of Fear, from Ancient Times to the Present, he begins by stating that there are currently no fewer than four common meanings of the word witch. To paraphrase: someone who uses magic for malevolent means; any person who uses magic at all (whether good, bad, or neutral); a follower of nature-based Paganism, such as Wicca; and a figure of transgressive female power. Many historical books like his tend to focus on the first definition. After all, witches have been associated with evil since they first apparated on the scene. But today these definitions blur together, informing and influencing each other. The witch wouldn’t now be a feminist icon, for example, without that primary malevolent meaning to riff off of and rail against.

In 1863, Michelet’s book was translated into English under the far more titillating title Satanism and Witchcraft, and its direct influence can be seen in the work of the twentieth-century poets, filmmakers, and artists, including the Surrealists, who incorporated Michelet’s romanticized vision of the witch into their work.

Woman, Church, and State, published just five years before her death. In it, she writes that the subjugation of women happening in her time was comparable to the European witch hunts. She believed that the witches of Western Europe were persecuted because their wisdom was a threat to the patriarchal Church. As Gage writes: “Whatever the pretext made for witchcraft persecution we have abundant proof that the so-called ‘witch’ was among the most profoundly scientific persons of the age. The church having forbidden its offices and all external methods of knowledge to woman, was profoundly stirred with indignation at her having through her own wisdom, penetrated into some of the most deeply subtle secrets of nature: and it was a subject of debate during the middle ages if learning for woman was not an additional capacity for evil, as owing to her, knowledge had first been introduced in the world.”

Gage embraced a reclamation of the divine feminine as her spiritual practice, and is the first known suffragist to reclaim the word ‘witch.’ . . . Without Gage, witches might still be viewed as solely evil in popular culture.”

She’s very unhappy because she never gets what she wants, Mister Rogers. You know, most of us get something along the line. But far as we know, that witch just never got what she wanted, and mainly she wanted those ruby slippers. Because they had lots of power, and she wanted more power.

So often we try to classify. To put one another into distinct, labeled envelopes, and then seal them shut with the flick of a tongue. We resist nuance at every turn, and that goes tenfold for women. They are prudes or sluts, passive or pushy, babes or bitches, harlots or hags. If you show interest in fashion and beauty and sparkly dresses, you’re considered vapid, a lightweight, and dismissed or discredited. If you voice your opinions or ambition, or talk too often or laugh too loud, you are domineering, thirsty, a harpy, a nag.

Sabrina Spellman didn’t have a last name for the first thirty-four years of her existence as a pop-culture character. Blond, mod, and mischievous, Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch, as she was originally called, first appeared in Archie’s Mad House #22 in October 1962.

Throughout the series, whether in the comics or subsequent television shows, Sabrina finds herself torn between obeying authority and following her heart. She often longs to be a regular teen, at times wishing her powers would leave her entirely. Sentiments like these hint at the pathos shared by so many teen girls, as they are caught between the desire to conform to one’s social group and the need to establish oneself as an independent young adult.

These conflicts proved to be far more resonant with readers than Sabrina creators George Gladir and Dan DeCarlo originally imagined: “I think we both envisioned it as a one-shot and were surprised when fans asked for more,” Gladir is quoted as saying in 2007. Due to popular demand, Sabrina became a recurring character in the Archie’s Mad House and Archie’s T.V. Laugh-Out comic book series, as well as appearing in several animated TV shows. Eventually she became the star of her own spin-off comic book series in 1971, setting the template for generations of teen witches to come.

The Craft is like an occult version of Heathers, another film about high school vengeance taken much too far. We’re supposed to identify with these underdogs and to feel vicarious satisfaction when their revenge plots work. But then we get castigated when their targets suffer and the girls get swept up in power trips. The film slaps us five, then slaps our wrists.

As with Louise’s and Sabrina’s catalyzing sixteenth birthdays, it is common for teen witch stories to have the protagonist’s powers activate when she “comes of age,” a clear metaphor for puberty and the double-edged sword of sexuality. Sometimes her witchcraft is a threat, and sometimes it’s an asset. In some instances she inherits her magic, but in others it’s self-taught or bestowed upon her by another person. But often her new abilities are something that she must learn to hone with practice and restraint, or else relinquish entirely. She must make decisions about the kind of witch she wants to be.

The concept of a satanic witches’ gathering—the Witches’ Sabbath or sabbat, as it was sometimes called—came in large part from a few key mid-fifteenth-century texts including Johannes Nider’s Formicarius, the anonymously written Errores gazoriorum, and Claude Tholosan’s Ut magorum et maleficioreum errores (the titles just trip off the tongue).

Regardless, we do know that the primary, if not sole, author was Heinrich Kramer, a Dominican inquisitor with a major vendetta against women. Though it’s true that his writings were informed by centuries of societal beliefs about female inferiority, he was a master of misogyny and paranoia in his own right.

So let’s get this straight: witches could copulate with devils, commit murder, and change the weather itself—but causing the actual loss of such an important extremity was too much for Kramer to fathom: Don’t worry, boys, it’s just a trick of the eye! Even all-powerful witches could not breach the sanctity of the boner.

Per Montague Summers’s introduction to the 1948 English edition: “The Malleus lay on the bench of every judge, on the desk of every magistrate. It was the ultimate, irrefutable, unarguable authority.” As such, it set the standard for who witches were (i.e., women), and how they should be punished (with brutality).

So, though ideas about sexually promiscuous female devil-worshippers certainly existed before this, it’s fair to say that the Malleus Maleficarum sealed the deal. It wasn’t just a femme fatale that Kramer helped create. It was a femme infernale.

Must phallocentrism exist even in the inferno? But for me, that oversimplifies the point. I think these tales about devils and witches represent something more, for they are commentaries upon the fallacy of female deficiency. They offer a different kind of fantasy: a vision of a world where women can live unrestrained and unashamed. In these stories, the witch is lit up at last: not from being burned at the stake, but rather from the blaze of her own inner fire.

As I write, birth control and family planning have been under relentless attack by the Trump administration in various ways, prompting the sexagenarian Cecile Richards, then president of Planned Parenthood, to tell CNN in May 2018 that “this administration is the worst for women that I’ve seen in my lifetime.” Not only does Trump seem to support the vice president’s promise that “[w]e’ll see Roe vs. Wade consigned to the ash heap of history where it belongs,” he is also the first sitting president to be the keynote speaker at the annual Campaign for Life Gala held by the antiabortion group Susan B. Anthony List. His Supreme Court picks are alleged pro-life proponents as well.

‘What has gone wrong?’ said Monsieur, calmly looking out. A tall man in a nightcap had caught up a bundle from among the feet of the horses, and had laid it on the basement of the fountain, and was down in the mud and wet, howling over it like a wild animal. ‘Pardon, Monsieur the Marquis!’ said a ragged and submissive man, ‘it is a child.’ ‘Why does he make that abominable noise? Is it his child?’ ‘Excuse me, Monsieur the Marquis – it is a pity – yes.’ The fountain was a little removed; for the street opened, where it was, into a space some ten or twelve yards square. As the tall man suddenly got up from the ground, and came running at the carriage, Monsieur the Marquis clapped his hand for an instant on his sword-hilt. ‘Killed!’ shrieked the man, in wild desperation, extending both arms at their length above his head, and staring at him. ‘Dead!’9 The people closed round, and looked at Monsieur the Marquis. There was nothing revealed by the many eyes that looked at him but watchfulness and eagerness; there was no visible menacing or anger. Neither did the people say anything; after the first cry, they had been silent, and they remained so. The voice of the submissive man who had spoken, was flat and tame in its extreme submission. Monsieur the Marquis ran his eyes over them all, as if they had been mere rats come out of their holes. He took out his purse. ‘It is extraordinary to me,’ said he, ‘that you people cannot take care of yourselves and your children. One or the other of you is for ever in the way. How do I know what injury you have done my horses. See! Give him that.’ He threw out a gold coin for the valet to pick up, and all the heads craned forward that all the eyes might look down at it as it fell. The tall man called out again with a most unearthly cry, ‘Dead!’ He was arrested by the quick arrival of another man, for whom the rest made way. On seeing him, the miserable creature fell upon his shoulder, sobbing and crying, and pointing to the fountain, where some women were stooping over the motionless bundle, and moving gently about it. They were as silent, however, as the men. ‘I know all, I know all,’ said the last comer. ‘Be a brave man, my Gaspard! It is better for the poor little plaything to die so, than to live. It has died in a moment without pain. Could it have lived an hour as happily?’ ‘You are a philosopher, you there,’ said the Marquis, smiling. ‘How do they call you?’ ‘They call me Defarge.’ ‘Of what trade?’ ‘Monsieur the Marquis, vendor of wine.’ ‘Pick up that, philosopher and vendor of wine,’ said the Marquis, throwing him another gold coin, ‘and spend it as you will. The horses there; are they right?’ Without deigning to look at the assemblage a second time, Monsieur the Marquis leaned back in his seat, and was just being driven away with the air of a gentleman who had accidentally broken some common thing, and had paid for it, and could afford to pay for it; when his ease was suddenly disturbed by a coin flying into his carriage and ringing on its floor.

unchanged front, except as to the spots on his nose: ‘I would ride over any of you very willingly, and exterminate you from the earth. If I knew which rascal threw at the carriage, and if that brigand were sufficiently near it, he should be crushed under the wheels.’ So cowed was their condition, and so long and so hard their experience of what such a man could do to them, within the law and beyond it, that not a voice, or a hand, or even an eye, was raised. Among the men, not one. But, the woman who stood knitting looked up steadily, and looked the Marquis in the face. It was not for his dignity to notice it; his contemptuous eyes passed over her, and over all the other rats; and he leaned back in his seat again, and gave the word ‘Go on!’

‘What of Charles?’ ‘Here.’ ‘Here, in Paris?’ ‘Has been here, some days – three or four – I don’t know how many – I can’t collect my thoughts. An errand of generosity brought him here unknown to us; he was stopped at the barrier, and sent to prison.’ The old man uttered an irrepressible cry. Almost at the same moment, the bell of the great gate rang again, and a loud noise of feet and voices came pouring into the court-yard. ‘What is that noise?’ said the Doctor, turning towards the window. ‘Don’t look!’ cried Mr Lorry. ‘Don’t look out! Manette, for your life, don’t touch the blind!’

Mr Barsad, now in the employ of the republican French government, was formerly in the employ of the aristocratic English government, the enemy of France and freedom. That’s an excellent card. Inference clear as day in this region of suspicion, that Mr Barsad, still in the pay of the aristocratic English government, is the spy of Pitt,5 the treacherous foe of the Republic crouching in its bosom, the English traitor and agent of all mischief so much spoken of and so difficult to find. That’s a card not to be beaten. Have you followed my hand, Mr Barsad?’ ‘Not to understand your play,’ returned the spy, somewhat uneasily. ‘I play my Ace, Denunciation of Mr Barsad to the nearest Section Committee.

Most women were relegated to the role of muse within these circles, representing the femme-enfant or “innocent woman” archetype with which Breton and his followers were transfixed. A precursor to the “manic pixie dreamgirl” trope of today, the femme-enfant’s youth was to be mooned over, her naïveté aspired to, her pure countenance captured in poetry and paint. She was not a creator herself though.

How did the witch come to take on these attributes? Was she really a poisoner, a healer, a maker of love philters, or merely a deranged old woman muttering to her jasper-eyed cat? Did she create the danger you feel, or did frightened men, seeking to embody their sense of danger, invent the witch?

To understand the word witch is to understand anthropology, history, the history of religion, the history of the relations between the sexes, to understand, above all, the unconscious of the human being.

All that is left of the ancient Mother Goddess in our spiritually bankrupt civilization are three figures: the Wicked Witch, the Virgin Mary, and the folk concept of “Mother Nature”—a powerful paradigm of female generativity now debased into a cartoon character.

Why does it matter if we split off Woman from her sexuality and if we allow her only two roles in the world: Wicked Witch or Sanitized Virgin? It matters because it is a lie. Women do not give birth without impregnation by men, and the female sexuality that patriarchy regards as evil is, in essence, the origin of all human life upon the planet.

I think it may safely be said that as we begin to understand the figure of the witch in myth, poetry, and religion, we will have gone a long way toward understanding women in patriarchal society and the strange psychological accommodations they have had to make—in their lives, in their religions, and in their art.
